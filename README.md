# Analysis of Intensity vs Frequency 

This is the analysis stage for the results from ARROW radio astronomy on 4/11/21. The tables show targets from longitudes 40 to 90. The initial plan was to scan 50 - 100 longitudes, but the radio frequency interference (RFI) was particularly bad at longitude 100.

The frequencies recorded for these longitudes are *centred* around the rest frequency of hydrogen.
